            <h3>Process to date</h3>
            <p class="bg-warning">We are contacting the customer through the use of social media.
            We are able to know how people feel about the product.
            The market is positive about the Product and benefit they will get form it.
            The first thing I was doing as a founder of Frozen Mo:Mo was founding the team.
            It was the most tedious job.
            <p>
            As finding good team member is like solving the half of the work.
            We are in the phase of Going-To-Market phase.
            We have the potential buyer of about 2000 as of Jan 21st, 2018.
            We are using the direct labor method that will reduce the cost further.
            We already contacted the telecommunication company to install toll-free number.
            Our Team member living in Nepal already contacted the farmer.
            Also signed the contract with the farmer to buy the product.
            We also contact the Airlines Company if they want to serve the product.
            Another potential buyer is the school and hospital catering service .
            Our On-Ground advisor and marketing agent are working on this.
            Registering the tread mark, copyright and company registration is almost ready to go ahead.
            However, the finance is stopping this process.</p>
